## Introduction: Concert Calendar was inspired by my love of going to see live music and often forgetting exact dates and times
of all the events. After you sign up and login to the app you can search by name or keyword for your favorite bands, artist,
DJ's and more. Once through the initial search you are shown all the artist pertaining to that search and shows if those
artist have any upcoming shows. Names listed in blue have upcoming shows and can be cliked on for more information on that 
artist, red names are currently not touring and therefore no shows can be added. Clicking on the artist name will take you to a
listing of upcoming shows, and allows you to click on each show for more information. Once you click on the show you are
displayed all the information on that show including, all artist playing that specific event, venue and Date. At the bottom
of the listing is the ability to add that event to your own personalized concert tracker. You can add as many shows as you 
would like or even create a custom event of your own. The my events tab at the top takes you to your calendar and displays all
shows added to your calendar.

results are easy to ready, and tracking your shows comes with ease. The app uses songkicks api to display artist and 
information on all types of events. From large music festivals to small shows in bars, concert calendar has you covered. If
